# Instruction for setting up fork branch and setting up your local IDE

1. Dev tools/IDEs
  a. Eclipse
  b. PostgreSQL

2. Installing the plug-in (STS) into  your Eclipse. This is the dev plug-in for Spring boot and Gradle. You can find it from marketplace.

3. Creating local DB using the PostgreSQL. In this case, I used 'carpool' as my DB's name, 'postgres' as the username, 'password' as the DB password. If you create the DB with different name and password, change the properties in application.properties file before starting the server.
